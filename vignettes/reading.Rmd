## Extra reading

1. [Geomcompr by Robin Lovelace](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/): A fantastic guide from Introduction to Advanced about all things Spatial in the R world.



## Data sources

1. UK Shape data. This was grabbed directly from the **eurostat** package, we've then done a bit of manipulation to get it into it's current form.  

2. Us meth data. We grabbed this from [geocommons](http://geocommons.com/datasets?id=26). After that, we made up the pounds seized information to make it more interesting!
